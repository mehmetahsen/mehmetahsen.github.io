#### How to setup Hugo with GitHub Pages from scratch

As this is a first post, I thought it would be just to tell how this site came to be. Basically I followed 3 distinct tutorials:

[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)

[Quick start Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

[Hosting on Github Pages Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
